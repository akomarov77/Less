 1. Assume we have a method processString(String sentence) {...},
 you need to implement logic for:

 - Print out words which start from "a"
 - Print out words which end from "j"
 - Convert all words that start from "L" to upper case and
   to lower case that contains "T"
2. Replace in the String all ":" by ";".
Calculate a quantity of such replacements.
3. Assume that we have sentence, which contains "(" and ")".
Print out content that enclosed in brackets.
4. Assume that we have sentence, print out words that start and end
from the same letter.
